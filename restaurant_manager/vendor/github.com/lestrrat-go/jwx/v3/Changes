Changes
=======

v3 has many incompatibilities with v2. To see the full list of differences between
v2 and v3, please read the Changes-v3.md file (https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/blob/develop/v3/Changes-v3.md)

v3.0.0 1 Apr 2025
  * Release initial v3.0.0 series. Code is identical to v3.0.0-beta2, except
    for minor documentation changes.

    Please note that v1 will no longer be maintained.

    Going forward v2 will receive security updates but will no longer receive
    feature updates. Users are encouraged to migrate to v3. There is no hard-set
    guarantee as to how long v2 will be supported, but if/when v4 comes out,
    v2 support will be terminated then.

v3.0.0-beta2 30 Mar 2025
  * [jwk] Fix a bug where `jwk.Set`'s `Keys()` method did not return the proper
    non-standard fields. (#1322)
  * [jws][jwt] Implement `WithBase64Encoder()` options to pass base64 encoders
    to use during signing/verifying signatures. This useful when the token
    provider generates JWTs that don't follow the specification and uses base64
    encoding other than raw url encoding (no padding), such as, apparently,
    AWS ALB. (#1324, #1328)

v3.0.0-beta1 15 Mar 2025
  * [jwt] Token validation no longer truncates time based fields by default.
    To restore old behavior, you can either change the global settings by
    calling `jwt.Settings(jwt.WithTruncation(time.Second))`, or you can
    change it by each invocation by using `jwt.Validate(..., jwt.WithTruncation(time.Second))`

v3.0.0-alpha3 13 Mar 2025
  * [jwk] Importing/Exporting from jwk.Key with P256/P386/P521 curves to
    ecdh.PrivateKey/ecdh.PublicKey should now work. Previously these keys were not properly
    recognized by the exporter/importer. Note that keys that use X25519 and P256/P384/P521
    behave differently: X25519 keys can only be exported to/imported from OKP keys,
    while P256/P384/P521 can be exported to either ecdsa or ecdh keys.

v3.0.0-alpha2 25 Feb 2025
  * Update to work with go1.24
  * Update tests to work with latest latchset/jose
  * Fix build pipeline to work with latest golangci-lint
  * Require go1.23

v3.0.0-alpha1 01 Nov 2024
  * Initial release of v3 line.
